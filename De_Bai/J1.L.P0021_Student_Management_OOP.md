## Title
Create a Java console program to manage students.

## Background Context

Write a program to manage information of student. The program implements terminology of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. OOP is one of the best choosing ways to design software program.

In this assignment, we will use **ArrayList** to store list of student. In fact, ArrayList is popular used to manipulate with data. ArrayList provides some useful methods, such as `add()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.

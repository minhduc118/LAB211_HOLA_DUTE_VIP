## Program Specifications

Create a program as follows input:
- Student information includes: Student name, class name, the marks Math, Physical and Chemistry in the range from 1 to 10.

Display on screen the information:
- Students' Type following the conditions:
  - **A**: mark > 7.5
  - **B**: 6.6 < mark <= 7.5
  - **C**: 4 < mark <= 6.6
  - **D**: mark <= 4.
- Student Type statistics by %.

---

## Function Details

### Function 1: Display GUI and Input Data.
- Users run the program. The program prompts users to input student data.
- When users stop inputting Student data, run Function 2.

### Function 2: Perform function
- The program classifies students and gives student rank statistics by %.
- Display notify result of students together with statistic results and exit the program.

## Guidelines

### Student must implement the methods:
- `createStudent`
- `averageScore`
- `getReportByType`
- `getReportTypeOfStudent`

in startup code.

---

## Suggestion

### Create a class Student contains the following properties:
- Student Name, Class, Math, Physical, Chemistry, Average, Type.

### Create a class Mark calculator, classify students, calculate student type statistics, and set the results on student object.

### Given the metrics:
- **A** ≥ 7.5
- **B** ≥ 7
- **C** ≥ 5
- **D** < 5

## Function Signatures

### Function 1: Input Student Info
```java
public Student createStudent(String name, String classes, double maths, double chemistry, double physics)
```
- **Input:**
  - `name`: Student name
  - `classes`: Class.
  - `maths`: Math mark.
  - `chemistry`: Chemistry mark.
  - `physics`: Physical mark.
- **Return:** student object

### Function 2: Student classification.
```java
public List<Student> averageScore(List<Student> listStudent)
```
- **Input:** `students`: the list of students not classified yet.
- **Return:** the list of students already classified.

### Function 3: Student type statistics
```java
public HashMap<String, Double> getReportByType(List<Student> students)
```
- **Input:** `students`: the list of students already classified.
- **Return:** student type statistics by % by the key A, B, C, D

### Function 4: Get student type
```java
public String getReportTypeOfStudent(Student student)
```
- **Input:** `student`: student object
- **Return:** Type (A, B, C, D)

## Data Class

### Student Class:
```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private String classes;
    private double maths;
    private double physics;
    private double chemistry;
    private double average;
    private String type;  // A, B, C, D
    
    // Constructor, getters, setters
}
```

---

## Classification Rules

| Type | Average Score Condition |
|------|------------------------|
| A | average > 7.5 |
| B | 6.6 < average <= 7.5 |
| C | 4 < average <= 6.6 |
| D | average <= 4 |

### Average Calculation:
```java
average = (maths + physics + chemistry) / 3
```

---

## Validation Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Name | Không được rỗng |
| Maths | 0 <= mark <= 10, phải là số |
| Physics | 0 <= mark <= 10, phải là số |
| Chemistry | 0 <= mark <= 10, phải là số |

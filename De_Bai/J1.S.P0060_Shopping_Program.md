## Class Design

### Person Class:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private Wallet wallet;
    
    // Constructor, getters, setters
}
```

### Wallet Class:
```java
public class Wallet {
    private int amount;
    
    public int calcTotal(int[] bills) {
        // TODO: Calculate total of all bills
    }
    
    public boolean payMoney(int total) {
        // TODO: Check if amount >= total
    }
}
```

| [200, 200] | 200 | 400 | ❌ Can't buy (200 < 400) |
| [50, 50, 50] | 150 | 150 | ✅ Can buy (150 >= 150) |
